# sys and sys.argv 


## Overview of sys and sys.argv in Python:

Using Python scripts inside Nextflow with sys and sys.argv allows you to pass command-line arguments from a Nextflow workflow to a Python script, making it more dynamic and flexible.

sys: A module in Python that provides functions and variables to interact with the interpreter.
sys.argv: A list in the sys module that holds the command-line arguments passed to the Python script.
sys.argv[0]: The name of the script.
sys.argv[1], sys.argv[2], etc.: Additional arguments passed to the script.


## Example of Python Script Using sys.argv:

This Python script takes two arguments: an input file and an output prefix.

```

import sys

def process_file(infile, prefix):

    with open(infile, 'r') as f:
        content = f.read()
    # Simulating some processing and writing the output
    with open(f"{prefix}_output.txt", 'w') as out:
        out.write(content)

if __name__ == "__main__":

    if len(sys.argv) != 3:
        print("Usage: python script.py <input_file> <output_prefix>")
    else:
        infile = sys.argv[1]
        prefix = sys.argv[2]
        process_file(infile, prefix)

```
		
## Integrating the Python Script with Nextflow:


You can call the Python script within a Nextflow process by passing the required arguments through sys.argv. Nextflow allows you to pass file paths or parameters from the workflow into the Python script.

### Example Nextflow Script:

```

nextflow.enable.dsl=2

process runPythonScript {
    input:
        path infile
        val prefix

    output:
        path "*.txt" // Expecting the Python script to produce some output files

    script:
    """
    python script.py $infile $prefix
    """
}

workflow {
    // Example inputs
    filechannel = Channel.fromPath('inputfile.txt')
    prefix = 'output_prefix'

    runPythonScript(filechannel, prefix)
}
```

## Explanation:

Python Script:

The script uses sys.argv to accept two arguments: the input file and a prefix for the output file.
Nextflow Process (runPythonScript):

input: The infile (a file) and prefix (a string) are passed to the Python script.
output: We expect an output file matching the pattern "*.txt", which is generated by the Python script.
script: The Python script is executed with $infile and $prefix passed as arguments.
Running the Workflow:
You can run the Nextflow workflow, which will:

Pass inputfile.txt and output_prefix to the Python script.
The Python script will process the file and create an output file using the prefix.

## In summary:

sys.argv is used in Python to capture command-line arguments, which Nextflow passes through the script block.
You can integrate Python scripts with Nextflow by providing file paths or parameters from the workflow to the script using sys.argv.
